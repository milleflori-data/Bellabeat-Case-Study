The company has asked me, a (theoretical) Jr. Analyst to parse through a dataset that they have\nprovided and analyze the data in order to be able to give them a summary,recommendations,deliverables, and a presentation. The dataset is a small sample-size with no larger than 33 participants and was created in 2016 by Mobius via mTurk crowdsource surveys. The dataset was collected over a two-month time period with anonymous ID masking and variables such as: Date/Time,Total Steps, Calories Burned, Sedentary Time, Intensity, Sleep, Distance, Weight, BMI,and more. The variables are broken down into different files and tables; likely due to try to remain in good keeping with pop.sample size ratio of 10 observers per variable for Regression Analysis. Sršen asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. She then wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation. These questions will guide your analysis:\n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy? \n\nBellabeat would like the data input that was tracked using a FitBit smart device to be summarized. They have chosen this dataset because the product is similar to one of their products;\"Time\" is a smart watch designed for women. Other products made by Bellabeat are the Bellabeat App, Leaf, Spring, and Bellabeat Membership. I will create the following deliverables:\n\n1. A clear summary of the business task\n2. A description of all data sources used\n3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n4. A summary of your analysis\n5. Supporting visualizations and key findings\n6.

She points you to a specific data set:\n● FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set\ncontains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of\npersonal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes\ninformation about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.\nSršen tells you that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another data to help\naddress those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.\nNow, prepare your data for analysis using the following Case Study Roadmap as a guide:\nCase Study Roadmap - Prepare\nGuiding questions\n● Where is your data stored?\n● How is the data organized? Is it in long or wide format?\n● Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?\n● How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?\n● How did you verify the data’s integrity?\n● How does it help you answer your question?\n● Are there any problems with the data?\nKey tasks\n1.

Failing that, I've got jotted notes of each step spread on paper hardcopies. I make clean copies for me to manipulate in my spreadsheet. I rename the masked ID's to something visually cleaner and easier to view. Instead of the numerical strings I copy/paste each unique ID number and find/replace with a new generated ID using a User_One:User_Thirtythree format.
